    "# Falcon algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm provides authentication approach to determinate signatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Math Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "This part describes math problems which accurs in this algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learning With Errors\n",
    "    Given random matrix A in Z(n Ã— m)q, secret vector s in Z (m q) and noisy vector e in Z (n q)\n",
    "    b = As + e (mod q)\n",
    "    Although Falcon does not directly use LWE, the hardness of related problems over lattices indirectly supports Falcon's security.\n",
    "- Closest Vector Problem\n",
    "    CVP involves finding the lattice vector closest to a given target vector.\n",
    "    lattice L and a target vector t, find v in L, ||t - v|| is min.\n",
    "    Falcon uses CVP in the signing process. A signature corresponds to a lattice vector that is close to a hashed message.\n",
    "- Shortest Vector Problem\n",
    "    SVP involves finding the shortest non-zero vector in a lattice. Like CVP, SVP is computationally hard.\n",
    "    lattice L, find non-zero vector v in L. ||v|| is min.\n",
    "    Falcon's security partly relies on the hardness of SVP. Knowing a short basis of the lattice allows efficient signing, but without it, the problem is intractable.\n",
    "- Gausian Sampling\n",
    "    Gaussian sampling is a mathematical technique used in Falcon to ensure that the signatures are statistically indistinguishable from a random noise distribution over the lattice.\n",
    "    Sample vectors from a Gaussian distribution centered around a lattice point with a specified standard deviation.\n",
    "    Prevents information leakage about the private key through statistical attacks."
